About a month has passed since we relaunched [AreWeWebYet](http://www.arewewebyet.org/) and quite a few news and updates made the rounds. To make it easier for you to stay up to date with current developments in Rust-Web, we decided to launch the RustWebDigest – a semi regular blog series from the AWWY curators on the state of affairs and changes since the last update. Welcome to edition #1.

## Getting started just got easier

We've added a [new "Getting Started" section to the homepage](/#getting-started) to highlight great resources to make it easier for you get into rust web development. One especially important news in there was the [launch of the clippy service by the Bashy Initiative](http://www.bashy.io/news/2016/03/05/clippy-linting-as-a-service/), a rust linting service which ships [with 100% annotated source code](https://clippy.bashy.io/docs/) for everyone to learn from.

## Servo in Summer of code

Servo was accepted to both Google Summer of Code and Rails Girls Summer of Code. If you are interested to join either program, take a [look at the announcement blog post for more info](https://blog.servo.org/2016/03/02/summer-of-code/)

## rust-url approaches v1

In other news from the servo project, the famous Rust-URL-Crate for URL parsing and handling is approaching version 1.0 and is [looking for feedback on their API design and data structures](https://github.com/servo/rust-url/pull/176).

## Crate releases
