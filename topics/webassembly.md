title: "WebAssembly"

level: 2

intro: WebAssembly is currently being designed as an open standard by the W3C Community Group
 that includes representatives from all major browsers.
 There are two major libraries for JavaScript ffi - `wasm-bindgen` and `stdweb`. Eventually,
 they will [share](https://github.com/koute/stdweb/issues/318) the same build tools.
 But at the moment to build `wasm-bindgen` project - `wasm-pack` is required, and
 for `stdweb` there is a `cargo-web`. Current ffi bindings for JavaScript api
 are quite low-level. There is an initiative to build a modular toolkit
 named [gloo](https://rustwasm.github.io/2019/03/12/lets-build-gloo-together.html)

packages:
 - cargo-web
 - dodrio
 - dominator
 - stdweb
 - wasm-bindgen
 - wasm-pack
 - gloo
 - plaster
 - seed
 - yew
